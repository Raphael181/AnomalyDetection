# Anomaly Detection in Energy Consumption Data

## Overview

This Streamlit application demonstrates anomaly detection in energy consumption data using the Isolation Forest algorithm. It generates synthetic data, including anomalies and outliers, and visualizes the results interactively.

## Features

- **Interactive Controls**: Adjust the number of samples, anomalies, and outliers using sliders.
- **Data Visualization**: View a plot of energy consumption with detected anomalies highlighted.
- **Data Preview**: See a preview of the synthetic dataset used for anomaly detection.
